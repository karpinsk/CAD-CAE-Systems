# CAD-CAE-Systems

This repository contains solutions to CAD/CAE systems tasks realized during the Computer Science course at AGH UST.

### Tasks

- \[[Lab-1](https://github.com/karpinsk/CAD-CAE-Systems/tree/main/splines)] Fit a spline to a curve using coefficients vector.
- \[[Lab-2](https://github.com/karpinsk/CAD-CAE-Systems/tree/main/splines_2d)] Draw initials using B-splines.
- \[[Lab-3](https://github.com/karpinsk/CAD-CAE-Systems/tree/main/bitmap)] Create 2D spline based on bitmap, generated for image.
- \[[Lab-4](https://github.com/karpinsk/CAD-CAE-Systems/tree/main/bitmap-approximation)] Draw bitmap for given image using adaptive algorithm.
- \[[Lab-5](https://github.com/xenoteo/Concurrent-Computing/tree/main/src/xenoteo/com/github/lab4)] Generate heat diffusion process based on bitmap, generated from input image.
